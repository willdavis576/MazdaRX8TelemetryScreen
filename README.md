# MazdaRX8TelemetryScreen

Teaching myself how CAN bus works.

The inital code tracking spreadsheet was created by South West EV UK on YouTube. I've since added the rest of the missing codes from the HighSpeed and MediumSpeed CAN bus. 
I'm yet to start documenting the SingleWire-LowSpeed CAN bus. 

Initially an Arduino Nano coupled with an MCP2515 CAN bus controller was used to collect the data.
Currently in the process of upgrading to the Adafruit Feather CAN express for a smaller foot print.

The aim if this project is to create a custom HUD to be mounted in the A-pilar of a Mazda RX8. 
I'm using a Nextion TFT screen as a display and connected inside a 3D printed mount that clips into the A-pilar's plastic covering.
